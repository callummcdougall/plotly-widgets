This is the big one. Matplotlib does make interactive plots, but they aren't nearly as big a feature for that programming langauge. In contrast, all of Plotly's graphs are interactive by default. You can zoom in on particular chunks of data, hover over it to see values, etc. This is a massive help when you're trying to make sense of data, whether that means examining the activations of neurons in a transformer, or examining in detail a certain trading pattern from a week in 2019.

Below is just one example of a powerful interactive graph which you can create with a very small amount of code. You can try hovering over datapoints to see extra information, or clicking and dragging to zoom in on a section of the graph (and double clicking to reset the axes)."""

## Intuitive functions and parameters

I personally found matplotlib quite hard to learn, because the functions and params and the ways they were used never seemed intuitive for me. Plotly always seemed more straightforward. To summarise how the core parts of it work:

> **You first define a figure. This can either be from plotly express (e.g. `px.scatter`) or from plotly graph objects (e.g. `go.Figure(data=go.Scatter)`). `px` generally requires less code, while `go` requires more code but gives you more low-level control. Both `px` and `go` will accept data in the form of lists or arrays, but if you use `px` then you have the added option of passing in data as a dataframe, and having the other arguments refer to column names of that dataframe.**

> **You can then update the figure by calling the method `update_traces` (to change the data) or `update_layout` (to change the appearance). Most parameters are accessed via nested dictionaries, e.g. you would pass `title = dict(text="My Title")` into the update layout function to change the title. This can also be abbreviated to `title_text="My Title` (this is called magic underscore notation in Plotly).**

The [documentation pages](https://plotly.com/python/) for Plotly are also really good, and you can find basically any kind of graph you want there."""

Widgets are interactive ways to control certain values in Python (e.g. sliders, or dropdown menus).

This is another great way to explore your data in more detail."""

### **Plotly graph objects** 
* Usually imported as **`import plotly.graph_objects as go`**
* More low-level, and gives you more control over the graph
* Makes some features easier to implement, e.g. subplots or faceted plots
    
### **Plotly express**
* Usually imported as **`import plotly.express as px`**
* Creates entire figures at once, with very little code
* Automates a lot of plotly features, like hover labels and styling
* Very useful for quite niche graphs (e.g. treemaps)
* Can read in data as a dataframe, rather than just arrays

### Which one to use?

In reality, plotly express is built on top of graph objects, it just abstracts away some of the details. However, there are still times when graph objects are easier to use. In the code below, we'll see lots of examples of both.

One big advantage of plotly express is that data for graphs can be supplied by a Pandas dataframe. The basic idea is that you have `df` as your first argument, and then other arguments like `x`, `y`, `color` are set to column names rather than arrays. Below is an example of this in action:"""
