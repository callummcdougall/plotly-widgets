For this section, I'd recommend you use the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/callummcdougall/plotly-widgets/blob/main/WidgetsPlotlyGuideTrimmed.ipynb) instead, so you can actually go through each of the widgets yourself.

Alternatively, you can skip to the next section to see some examples of what it looks like when Plotly and Widgets work together (I have made these ones interactive).

Below, I've included a few screenshots from the notebook, showing the kinds of things you can do with widgets."""
